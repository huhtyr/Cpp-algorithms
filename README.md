# C++ Algorithmic Library & Solutions

This repository contains my personal library of C++ data structures and solutions.

## Contents
* **Custom Library:** Implementations of DSU and Trie from scratch.
* **Solutions:** Optimized solutions focusing on time/space complexity analysis.

## Highlights
* Written in **C++** using **STL** for efficiency.
* Focus on modular code structure and memory optimization.
* Includes solutions for Dynamic Programming, Graph Theory, and Advanced Data Structures.

*(Note: This repository is being updated as I solve more problems.)*
